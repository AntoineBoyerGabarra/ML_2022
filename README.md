## Machine Learning Course projects
Class Project 1

# _Introduction_
The project aims at classifying decay signature of collision events to be able to predict if they are the result of a Higgs Boson signal or only due to background noise. _Ã  changer_. The program is coded in python and run using Jupyter.
To make predictions, mutliples methods are implemented.
Before training our data, the set was visualized, analyzed and cleaned. 

# _README.md_
This file explains the structure of the repository

# _implementations.py/ipynb_
contains the functions that had to be implemented for the training. 

# _run.py/ipynb_
regroups the process of data visualization and cleaning
implents and runs the functions of _implementations.py/ipynb_
